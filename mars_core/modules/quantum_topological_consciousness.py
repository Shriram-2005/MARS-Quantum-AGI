    🔬 Advanced Persistent Homology Calculator for Consciousness Analysis 🔬
    
    Implements computational topology methods for analyzing consciousness structure.
    Uses persistent homology to detect and track topological features that represent
    stable consciousness patterns across multiple scales and time points.
    
    🏗️ MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION:
        • Persistent Homology: Tracks topological features across scale parameters
        • Vietoris-Rips Complex: Constructs simplicial complexes from point clouds
        • Betti Numbers: Counts holes in different dimensions (β₀, β₁, β₂, ...)
        • Filtration: Multi-scale analysis of consciousness structure
    
    🔍 TOPOLOGICAL ANALYSIS:
        • 0-dimensional features: Connected components (consciousness unity)
        • 1-dimensional features: Loops and cycles (consciousness integration)
        • 2-dimensional features: Voids and cavities (consciousness complexity)
        • Multi-scale persistence: Feature stability across scales
    
    📊 CONSCIOUSNESS INTERPRETATION:
        • Connected components → Unified consciousness regions
        • Loops → Information integration cycles
        • Voids → Higher-order consciousness structures
        • Persistence → Consciousness feature robustness
    
    🎯 APPLICATIONS:
        • Consciousness feature detection and tracking
        • Multi-scale consciousness structure analysis
        • Consciousness state comparison and classification
        • Temporal consciousness evolution monitoring
